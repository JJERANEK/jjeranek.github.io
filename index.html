    <p>Hello! I am Jordan! I have many hobbies, but I don't have enough time for them.
      I hope to be able to get a new job after this program to provide for my family and give me my time back!
    </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>If I seem like a nerd to you, it's because I am! I love gaming, and I know way too much
      about unimportant things. I'm supposed to be getting Pokemon Violet for Christmas, so I'm quite
      excited! I can't wait to have my own weird Pokemon motorcycle.
